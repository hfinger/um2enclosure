# Ultimaker2 Acrylglas Enclosure

These are the files for the enclosure of my ultimaker 2 clone.
The acrylglas was cut with a lasercutter. The layout for the lasecutter is in [acrylglas.pdf](acrylglas.pdf).

Several parts were 3d printed. See the corresponding STL files.
Specifically, the enclosure features an exhaust ventilation in one corner (see [CornerLargeWithFanMount.stl](CornerLargeWithFanMount.stl)).
The front door is attached to a self printed hinge (see [Hinge.stl](Hinge.stl)).
The top can be easily removed from the 3d printer to get better access to the print head when needed.

The following are some images of the finished printer:
